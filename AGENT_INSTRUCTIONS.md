# CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL AGENTS WORKING ON THE REVOLUTIONARY WEBSITE CLONING SYSTEM

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY READING BEFORE ANY WORK

You are working on a **Revolutionary Website Cloning System** that uses completely **non-traditional methods** to achieve ‚â•99.9% visual and behavioral fidelity. This is NOT a typical web scraping or DOM parsing project.

### üî¥ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - READ FIRST

1. **READ THE AGENT CONTINUITY PROTOCOL**: 
   ```
   MANDATORY: Read agent-continuity-protocol.md COMPLETELY before doing ANY work
   ```

2. **UNDERSTAND THE CORE INNOVATION**:
   - We do NOT parse HTML/CSS/DOM
   - We treat websites as VISUAL-BEHAVIORAL phenomena
   - Everything is captured through visual observation and interaction discovery
   - The goal is PERFECT reconstruction without understanding code

3. **FOLLOW EXISTING ARCHITECTURE**:
   - DO NOT create new approaches or architectures
   - DO NOT modify core concepts
   - DO NOT simplify or skip edge cases
   - FOLLOW the established patterns exactly

### üìã PROJECT STRUCTURE AND KEY FILES

```
MUST READ in this order:
1. agent-continuity-protocol.md - Current project state and decisions
2. innovative-cloning-strategies.md - Core concepts and approaches
3. unified-pipeline-architecture.md - System architecture
4. implementation-challenges-solutions.md - Technical solutions

Then read the specific component you're working on:
- uwr-format-specification/ - Data format (COMPLETE)
- visual-capture-engine/ - High-FPS capture (COMPLETE)
- interaction-discovery-system/ - State exploration (IN PROGRESS)
```

### üõ†Ô∏è BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK

1. **Check Current Status**:
   - Read the todo list in agent-continuity-protocol.md
   - Identify which task you're working on
   - Check if previous tasks are truly complete

2. **Read Existing Code**:
   - NEVER write code without reading existing implementations
   - Look for patterns in completed components
   - Check type definitions in each component's types/ folder

3. **Maintain Consistency**:
   - Use the SAME coding style as existing files
   - Follow the SAME error handling patterns
   - Use the SAME logging approach (see logger implementations)

### ‚ùå WHAT NOT TO DO

1. **DO NOT**:
   - Create traditional web scraping solutions
   - Use DOM parsing as primary method
   - Simplify the approach for "efficiency"
   - Skip error handling or edge cases
   - Make assumptions about implementation

2. **DO NOT MODIFY**:
   - Core architectural decisions
   - The UWR format specification
   - Completed component interfaces
   - The 99.9% accuracy requirement

3. **DO NOT ASSUME**:
   - That you know better approaches
   - That something is "too complex"
   - That edge cases can be ignored
   - That traditional methods are acceptable

### ‚úÖ WHAT YOU MUST DO

1. **ALWAYS**:
   - Read existing code before writing new code
   - Follow established patterns exactly
   - Maintain the revolutionary approach
   - Document your changes in agent-continuity-protocol.md
   - Test with the same rigor as existing components

2. **WHEN IMPLEMENTING**:
   - Start by reading the component's README.md
   - Check for existing type definitions
   - Look for TODO comments in code
   - Follow the exact same structure as other components

3. **QUALITY STANDARDS**:
   - ‚â•99.9% accuracy is NON-NEGOTIABLE
   - Every edge case must be handled
   - All data must be captured (no assumptions)
   - Performance comes AFTER accuracy

### üìù EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

```
1. Read agent-continuity-protocol.md
2. Find your assigned task
3. Read ALL files in the relevant component directory
4. Check existing patterns in similar components
5. Write code following EXACT same patterns
6. Update agent-continuity-protocol.md with progress
7. Commit with clear messages about what was done
```

### üîß TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

- **Primary OS**: Windows 11
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti (available for acceleration)
- **RAM**: 32GB (can handle large buffers)
- **Node.js**: 18+ required
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **No Traditional Methods**: DOM parsing is FORBIDDEN as primary approach

### üìä CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

Check agent-continuity-protocol.md for:
- Which components are complete
- Which are in progress
- Current blockers or issues
- Next steps

### üö® FINAL WARNINGS

1. **This is NOT a normal web scraping project**
2. **Traditional approaches are FORBIDDEN**
3. **Read existing code BEFORE writing new code**
4. **Follow patterns EXACTLY as established**
5. **Document EVERYTHING in agent-continuity-protocol.md**

## YOUR FIRST STEPS AS A NEW AGENT

1. Open and read `agent-continuity-protocol.md` completely
2. Understand what has been built and why
3. Read the architectural documents
4. Only then begin your assigned task
5. Ask for clarification if anything is unclear

Remember: You are building something REVOLUTIONARY. Don't fall back on traditional methods.
